## Root properties

Each **PRESENTA** document can be configured with some global settings defined in this way:

```js
{
  scenes:[...],
  aspect: 1.6,
  adapt: true,
  scheme: '',
  ...
}
```

| Prop name  | Description                                                  | Default value | Possible values            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| scenes     | The list of scene objects                                    | required      | Scene object array         |
| aspect     | Define the ratio between width and height                    | 1.6           | Any number                 |
| adapt      | Override `aspect` inferring it from the container size       | true          | true,false                 |
| scheme     | The color scheme class to apply to the whole presentation, such as `.vibrant` |               | Any valid class value      |
| fontkit    | The fontkit class to apply to the whole presentation, such as `.original` |               | Any valid class value      |
| theme      | The theme class to apply to the whole presentation, such as `.original` |               | Any valid class value      |
| colorvar   | The scheme color variation as defined in `scheme` CSS stylesheet | .a            | .a, .b, .c                 |
| transition | The transition class to apply to the whole presentation, such as `.verticalIn` |               | See the transition section |
| mode       | This property is used by some block to show two different states of the rendered content, useful when using the library to preview the `scenes` instead running the presentation | present       | present, preview           |
|            |                                                              |               |                            |

## Color schemes

A **color scheme** is a set of CSS selectors and custom properties used across the whole presentation defining the color look&feel.

**PRESENTA Lib** comes with a list of color schemes you can use out of the box by specifing its class name:

```js
{
  scheme: '.original'
}
```

- `.default` or leave empty
- `.vibrant`
- `.original`

Try to change the `scheme` property using one of the above values:

<pEditSchemeCol />

## Font kits

A **font kit** is a set of CSS properties and font files that define the fonts used in the presentation. 

**PRESENTA Lib** comes with a list of font kits you can use out of the box by specifing its class name:

```js
{
  fontkit: '.original'
}
```

- `.default` or leave empty
- `.vibrant`
- `.original`

## Themes

A **theme** is a set of CSS custom properties that are able to affect some visual aspect of the presentation and its blocks.

**PRESENTA Lib** comes with a list of font kits you can use out of the box using a class name:

```js
{
  theme: '.alternate'
}
```

- `.default` or leave empty
- `.alternate`

## Scenes

A scene is the container of group of blocks. Alongside the required `blocks` you can configure some specific properties in this way:

```js
{
  blocks: [...],
  props:{
    colorvar: '.a',
    scenePadding: 0
  }
}
```

| Prop name    | Description                                                  | Default value                     | Possible values             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| colorvar     | Define the color palette variation at scene level. You can define it also at block level. | .a                                | .a, .b, .c                  |
| backcolor    |                                                              | inherit from the `scheme` setting | any valid CSS color values  |
| scenePadding | The scene padding                                            | 0                                 | any valid CSS padding value |
|              |                                                              |                                   |                             |

## Blocks

A block is the minimal piece of content. It can sit together with other blocks in a scene. Each block depends of the block type (more on this later) as well as its configuration options. Nevertheless, there are some generic, block-related, properties that can be set for any type of blocks:

```js
{
  props:{
    colorvar: '.a', // .a|.b|.c
    blockWeight: 1
    blockOpacity: 1
  }
}
```

| Prop name    | Description                          | Default value          | Possible values             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| colorvar     | Define the color palette variation   | .a                     | .a, .b, .c                  |
| backcolor    |                                      | inherit from the theme | any valid CSS color values  |
| blockWeight  | Define the weight in the Flex layout | 1                      | any positive number         |
| blockPadding | The block padding                    | 0                      | any valid CSS padding value |
|              |                                      |                        |                             |

::: tip Understanding the `props` field

In general, any property in the `props` object will be injected according to these rules:

- If the value starts with a `.` then a class name will be injected in the block container concatenating the `key` with the `value` rsulting this class name: `.key__value`
- If the value doesn't start with a `.` then a CSS custom property will be injected in the block container using the `key` as property name alongside its value resultin in this CSS property: `--key: value;`

:::

### Text block

The `text` block is possibly the most obvious one allowing to display formatted text by using a subset of HTML tags. Here the basic configuration:

```js
{
  type: 'text',
  text: '<h1>Some Title</h1>'
}
```

The text automatically scales according to the space available as well as the additional `scale` parameter that allows to control the behaviour:

```js
{
  type: 'text',
  text: '<h1>Some Title</h1>',
  scale: 4
}
```

By default `scale` is `2` but to can increase or decrease as you wish.

Furthermore, there are a number of properties for more fine-tuning:

```js
{
  type: 'text',
  props:{
    textposition: '.cc',
    textalign: 'center',
    textpadding: '1rem',
    backcolor: '<someColor>'
  }
}
```


### Image

The `image` block allows to display, guess what, an image.
You need to provide an array of objects such as:

```js
{
  type: 'image',
  url: 'https://www.example.com/image1.jpg'
}
```

By default the image will `cover` the space available. You can change that behaviour using this setting:

```js
{
  type: 'image',
  size: 'cover|contain|fill|none|scale-down'
  url: '...'
}
```

| Prop name    | Description                          | Default value          | Possible values             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| colorvar     | Define the color palette variation   | .a                     | .a, .b, .c                  |
| backcolor    |                                      | inherit from the theme | any valid CSS color values  |
| blockweight  | Define the weight in the Flex layout | 1                      | any positive number         |
| blockpadding | The block padding                    | 0                      | any valid CSS padding value |
|              |                                      |                        |                             |



### Video

The `video` block allows to include a video file (in a browser compatible format).
The configuration is pretty straightforward:

```js
{
	type: 'video',
	url: 'https://www.example.com/myvideo.mp4'
}
```

Here the additional options for this block:

```js
{
	loop: false,
	autoplay: false,
  poster: '', // the video poster frame
  props:{
    videoSize: 'cover',
    videoPosition: 'center
  }
}
```

By default the video won't start automatically. To control the playback (play/pause) you can use the SPACEBAR key

### Embed

The `embed` block allows to embed external web objects by means of `iframe` tag.
The simplest way to embed a web resource is by using the `url` property:

```js
{
	type: 'embed',
	url: 'https://example.com'
}
```

If you have the embed code (the iframe code) you can use the `code` property:

```js
{
	type: 'embed',
	code: '<iframe src="https://example.com"></iframe>'
}
```

Additionally, you can provide a `poster` and `postersize` properties to load an image used in `preview` mode and during the loading phase:

```js
{
	type: 'embed',
	url: 'https://example.com'
	poster: 'https://example.com/mycover.jpg'
	postersize: 'cover' // cover|contain|none
}
```

### Further blocks

There are further blocks that can be included as external plugin. Here a list of the official supported external blocks:

- Youtube block
- Vega-Lite block
- Chart.js block

## Controlling the presentation

**PRESENTA Lib** includes some general functionalities that are common in a presentation document. These functions are called **Router Controllers** or just **Controllers** because they act globally on the whole presentation, usually referring to the internal router component that is responsible to control the document navigation.

Each Controller needs to be activated (and optionally configured) in the main config object under the `router` field, such as:

```Â js
{
  scenes:[...],
  router:{
    controller1: true,
    controller2: {
        somesetting:10
    },
    ...
    props:{
      
    }
  }
}
```

::: tip The `props` field

There's a special field, `props` which is not a controller but the place to add CSS properties of the activated controllers.

:::

Here the documentation of built-in controllers you may activate or not. External Controllers can be found in the plugin section.

### Keyboard

It allows to navigate back and forth using the keyboard arrows keys.

- `ArrowRight` and `ArrowDown` to go next
- `ArrowLeft` and `ArrowUp` to go previous

It's active by default, to disable, set it as `false`

```js
router:{
	keyboard:false
}
```



### Arrows

It allows to show two UI arrow elements to allows the back and forth navigation by clicking on them.

It's active by default, to disable, set it as `false`

```js
router:{
	arrows:false
}
```



### Black

It allows to show/hide a black screen by pressing the keyboard key `b`

It's active by default, to disable, set it as `false`

```js
router:{
	arrows:false
}
```

You can configure the keyboard key this way:

```js
router:{
  arrows:{
    key: 'b'
  }
}
```



### Fullscreen

It allows to run the presentation in fullscreen by pressing the keyboard key `f`

It's active by default, to disable, set it as `false`

```js
router:{
	arrows:false
}
```

You can configure the keyboard key this way:

```js
router:{
  arrows:{
    key: 'f'
  }
}
```



### Autoplay

It turns the navigation in auto-play.

To activate it:

```js
router:{
	autoplay:true
}
```

To configure it overriding the defaults:

```js
router:{
  autoplay:{
    delay: 4000, // 4 seconds
    noloop: false // it does loop by default
  }
}
```

This Controller reads also from the `scene` configuration in order to change the `delay` time on specific `scene`:

```js
{
  scenes:[{
    duration: 8000, // this scene will last 8 seconds instead the default delay
    blocks:[...]
  }]
}
```



### Focus

It allows to set the focus automatically instead waiting for the user click, allowing to use keyboard events without a first mouse interaction.

To activate it:

```js
router:{
	focus:true
}
```

::: tip Multiple instances

What happens when there are more that one instance on the page? Who gets the focus? 

The detection is based on the viewport intersection, thus, the instance that is visible gets the focus. If there are two or more visible instances, the last one in the vertical will be picked up. 

:::

### Progressbar

It shows a tiny progress bar representing the progression of the current navigation.

To activate it:

```js
router:{
	progressbar:true
}
```

The following CSS properties can be changed in the `props` field:

```js
router:{
  props:{
    progressbarColor: 'var(--forecolor)',
    progressbarHeight: '5px',
    progressbarBottom: 'initial'
  }
}
```



### Pagenum

It shows the current page number and total pages based on the current navigation.

To activate it:

```js
router:{
	pagenum:true
}
```

To configure it overriding the defaults:

```js
router:{
  pagenum:{
    template: '%s / %S' // %s is the current page num, %S is the total pages num
  }
}
```

The following CSS properties can be changed in the `props` field:

```js
router:{
  props:{
    pagenumTextAlign: 'right',
    pagenumPadding: '5px',
    pagenumFontSize: '10px',
    pagenumBackColor: 'none'
  }
}
```
