# Extend

**PRESENTA Lib** is designed to be extensible by means of external plugins. Currently there are three types of plugin depending of the type of the extension you want to provide:

- **Blocks** (media and content types)
- **Modules** (scene extensions)
- **Controllers** (router controllers or global behaviours)



## Installing a plugin

A plugin is a standalone piece of code that interact with a **PRESENTA Lib** instance. The way it has been developed depends on the developer preferences, thus, there's not a single way to describe the installation guideline.

Official plugins can be installed following [this section](/plugins/installation), plugins that followed the same development guidelines can be installed in the same way.

No matter the case, please refer always to the plugin documentation first.
