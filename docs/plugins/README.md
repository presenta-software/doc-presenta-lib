# Plugins

::: warning Dev Doc?

The plugin development documentation is coming soon. **Stay tuned!**

:::

In this section you can find the list of officially supported **PRESENTA Lib** plugins, sorted by  **type**.

## Blocks

A Block renders a content. When you need a different type of media or render a content in a different way, external blocks might help, such as:

- [Youtube](blocks/youtube)
- [Chartjs](blocks/chartjs)
- [Fitty](blocks/fitty)
- [Vega-Lite](blocks/vegalite)
- [ModelViewer](blocks/modelviewer)
- [Flowchart.js](blocks/flowchartjs)

<!--

::: tip Want to create your own Block?

Awesome! There's a [starter-kit](https://github.com/presenta-software/presenta-block-starter). If you plan to make it public, [let us know](mailto:support@presenta.cc)!
