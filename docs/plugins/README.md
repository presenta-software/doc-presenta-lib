# Plugins

::: warning Dev Doc?

The plugin development documentation is coming soon. **Stay tuned!**

:::

In this section you can find the list of officially supported **PRESENTA Lib** plugins, sorted by  **type**.

## Blocks

A Block renders a content. When you need a different type of media or render a content in a different way, external blocks might help, such as:

- [Youtube](https://github.com/presenta-software/presenta-block-youtube) to render and control a YT video
- [Vega-Lite](https://github.com/presenta-software/presenta-block-vegalite) to render a VL chart
- [Chartjs](blocks/chartjs) to render a Chart.js component
- [Fitty](https://github.com/presenta-software/presenta-block-fitty) to render a text using Fitty library


<!--

::: tip Want to create your own Block?
